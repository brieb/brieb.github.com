The assignment was to create a web server for a search engine. The purpose was
to encounter the Unix socket API, creating communication channels using TCP,
interacting with HTTP clients (i.e., web browsers), and using the Linux/Unix
system calls to create processes. 

I went above the requirements, adding the ability to view the file contents of
a result, authentication, Facebook-aided registration, and UI design.
