<ul>
  <li>Worked on a team of three to develop a web-based iPhone assignment aggregation application. Like an RSS aggregator, a student can subscribe to his or her courses and automatically get updates about upcoming assignments.</li>
  <li>Made paper prototypes, brainstormed ideas, conducted user tests, created demo videos, and designed some of the graphics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
  We worked on this project as part of Stanford's Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Course. Our goal was to make it as easy as possible to aggregate one's assignments to one place. Less time spent figuring out what to do means more time spent actually getting it done.
</p>

<h3>How?</h3>
<p>
The application was coded using php, jqTouch, and a MySQL database.
