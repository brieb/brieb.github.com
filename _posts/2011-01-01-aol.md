*   Learned CakePhp, jQuery, fundamental visual design, and a corporate login system in four weeks while designing and developing an interactive checklist for teams to use before launching products. I am the tech and design lead for the project, so I had a lot of freedom to design and develop the application, from the backed database structuring to the frontend interaction. 
*   Learned the Wordpress database structure and a PHP pdf library in three weeks to build a weekly report generator for an internal blog, that saves my boss hours every week.
