These are the features implemented by our website:
<ul>
	<li>Questions that support multiple answer possibilities. It is possible for  a quiz creator to specify a number of possible correct responses for fill in the blank, question response, and picture response questions</li>
	<li>Search Functionality - Using the search box at the top right of the page, it is possible to search for both users and quizzes.</li>
	<li>History - It is possible to see a users history in a variety of ways. The main section of the user's home page has tabs for "Your Created Quizzes" and "Your Recent Quizzes" which show recently created and taken quizzes respectively. There is also a dedicated history module on the right hand side of the page that slides down to show a more comprehensive history of the user's activity.</li>
	<li>The user home page has all of the required modules</li>
	<li>Each quiz has a summary page with the required information, including the option to edit the quiz if the user made the quiz.</li>
	<li>Quizzes have all of the required features: Random ordered question option, one vs multiple page display, and immediate correction.</li>
	<li>Quizzes have the optional feature practice mode. In practice mode, a user has three chances at the questions. With pagination, the user sees the answers to the questions that he or she gets wrong. The wrong questions go back into the list of questions and get redisplayed to the user later in the quiz.</li>
	<li>Quiz results show a comparison of the user's past performances on the quiz.</li>
	<li>Quiz results also show individual feedback on the incorrect questions. The user's answers are included in uneditable fields for reference, and the correct answers are listed underneath.
	<li>We have implemented a prettified custom error 404 page if an invalid URL is requested</li>
	<li>The form for creating an account uses AJAX to check on blur if the username typed is already in use</li>
	<li>The form for creating an account performs validation to make sure that all fields are full and that the two password fields match.</li>
	<li>Nearly every times we use a text field, we have used either javascript or CSS3 to display placeholder text that disappears on focus.</li>
	<li>The quiz creation and editing pages use JQuery to dynamically add new questions to the page without refreshing. The user can also add additional possible answers dynamically.</li>
	<li>The quiz creation and editing pages validate the form using client-side processing, highlighting textboxes left blank and forcing the user to fill all fields out. </li>
	<li>The quiz creation and editing pages allow the removal of questions and answers</li>
	<li>We have added an administrative interface (link visibile to admins in the header bar) at /admin.jsp that allows for:
		<ul><li>Getting statistics about the site:
			<ul><li>Number of users</li>
			<li>Number of quizzes</li>
			<li>Number of times quizzes have been taken</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Creating Announcements</li>
			<li>Removing Users</li>
			<li>Removing Quizzes</li>
			<li>Clearing a Quiz's History</li>
			<li>Promoting Users to administrator status</li>
			<li>Administrating quizzes and users is done through an AJAX powered search box that populates a dialog as the user types.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>We have changed the Database engine used by the MySql Server so that some of our tables can hold metadata about which which keys are foreign keys in other tables. This allows changes to one table to cascade to sub tables. For example:
		<ul><li>If it is necessary to change a quiz's ID, with one query on the quiz table that change cascades to all other tables holding quizID as a foreign key</li>
		<li>Deleting a quiz also deletes all of the questions and responses associated with that quiz. (Also in one simple query on the quizzes table)</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>We implemented a history table for tracking quiz usage analytics displaying historical performance data</li>
	<li>We implemented the optional achievements extension. Users are informed after making or taking quizzes whether they have earned a new achievement.
		<ul> <li>Achievements are shown on the right side of the page. </li>
			<li>Achievement that have not yet been earned are greyed out</li>	
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>We implemented quiz editing so that owners of quizzes can edit the quizzes they've created. The owners can edit aspects of their quiz such as question and answer content, number of questions, description, name, and quiz options like pagination, random order, etc. Once the user submits the edit form, the quiz retains all of its past history but contains the new information.</li>
	<li>The login and user creation forms are dynamically validated using AJAX.</li>
	<li>Quotation marks are handled gracefully when entered in quizzes and notes. We wrote our own code to safeguard user input and make the site much more robust.
	<li>Whenever possible we preferred to upadate pages asynchonously instead of refreshing.</li>
	<li>Our largest extension is the look and feel of the website. From CSS3 styling to AJAX-powered and JQuery-animated elements, this is where we had the most fun.</li>
</ul>

No three person features were omitted. In fact, all five person features were completed.
