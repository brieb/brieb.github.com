# Chapter 1: Technical Growth

Day one: I walk through the door on the first day of my internship, directly into a design sprint (something like [this](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-2012-10-02.html)), in which about ten members of the Khan Academy team were discussing a new feature for the website. The social aspects of KA, up to that point, were the discussions, sharing badges on Facebook, and using KA as part of a classroom. This new feature would add a social network within KA. By the conclusion of the multi-day design sprint, I learned that I would own this project as part of the community team.

There are several takeaways from this initial phase of my internship. First of all, wow! -- they are giving an intern the responsibility of building a substantial product that's social, an area in which KA hadn't gone into as much depth before. They aren't asking that intern to build out something pre-baked, they are involving her in the brainstorming, decision-making process -- valuable because that way she feels heard and understands why certain decisions were made.

This project excited me because I had used Khan Academy on my own before, and I didn't feel the other learners around me. The advantage of creating a social network within Khan Academy, as opposed to sending things over to existing social networks, is that KA can shape that community around learning being a uber-cool thing to do. :) The vision would be that learners can interact and grow with the people around them, which would lead to a more powerful and effective learning experience. There were still unanswered questions by the end of the design meeting ("social" is quite an open-ended problem). But, there were plenty of things to get started on.

There are always tons of projects progressing in parallel at KA -- the team moves quickly to solve problems that, as Sal describes, "billions are waiting" for. There are way more problems to solve than there are engineers to solve them. As a result, the "intern" title doesn't mean much -- everyone is needed. In this case, I was needed to head up the implementation of this project.

At KA, learning doesn't only happen on the website, it's ingrained into the culture. I grew the most through ownership, responsibility, and autonomy, from my direct mentor, and through code reviews. There was no limit to the parts of the stack that I could touch -- I headed up the data modeling, backend, frontend, and design! I love handling all of these parts, exercising technical and aesthetic creativity. And, I love that KA allowed me to express and grow those skills. To be clear, it's not that there weren't other engineers and designers available to take over the different parts. I just enjoy doing all of them, so they let me run with it.

Throughout my internship, I worked closely with my _fabulous_ mentor, Stephanie Chang. :) Every KA intern is assigned a mentor to work and meet with. Stephanie and I met every week to talk at a high level about how things are going and whether anything could be improved, for both me and the team. We met much more often to hash out different design ideas and to talk over implementation trade offs. Midway through the summer, we shared more of the implementation load, even having a few virtual, late-night coding sessions together. :D I loved Stephanie's mentorship, from the subtle lead-ins she'd give me during meetings - when an idea of mine that we'd talked about earlier was relevant - to the valuable feedback on code reviews, to contributing together on the project. Ben Kamens, Ben Komalo, Ben Alpert, Jason Rosoff, Craig Silverstein, Kitt Hirasaki, John Resig, Matt Wahl, and Matt Faus are among other amazing people that I worked with, either through code reviews or in-person feedback sessions.

KA has a really great code review culture. Code reviews aren't just a way to make sure that quality code makes it into the code base, they are leveraged as a tremendous learning opportunity. I received valuable feedback from over seven people across my diffs, offering different perspectives and growing me in different ways. I have authored, reviewed, and read through many code reviews where the code that goes out is far better than when it came in, and the conversations that go on lead to everyone becoming better engineers. Plus, KA uses Phabricator for code reviews, which has a meme feature that lets you upload images that anyone can insert into a comment. One of my proudest contributions (courtesy of Facebook stickers):

By the end of my internship, with the support of an amazing team, we accomplished many things, all of which I am very proud of:

- Facebook and Google contact import
- Optimizations for the Google contact import
- UI & design for the "following" feature
- Frontend code (learned an awesome JS/JSX library called React!)
- Backend code (learned Google App Engine)
- Data modeling
- API (Flask)

Each one of these bullet points has so much (exciting) depth -- I'll have to write blog posts about each of them! During the summer, we laid the foundation of the feature. I am excited about the meaningful interactions that the team will now implement on top of it, before launching it to the world.

My internship at KA was fantastic (understatement)! I would recommend it to anyone who shares my passion for making an large impact on important problems, as a part of a rockstar team.
