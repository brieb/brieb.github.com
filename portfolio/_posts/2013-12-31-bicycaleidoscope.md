This was a project completed as part of Stanford's <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a/index.html">Music 250a</a> course in Fall 2013.Â We built a musical instrument in the form of a giant kaleidoscope. Two bike wheels, filled with colorful gels, spin to control the bass line and the melody. Light streams the gels, reflecting in the kaleidoscope to produce brilliant visual effects to accompany the piece. We generate the harmony and melody via Hall effect sensors that detect magnets on the bike wheels and pass the input into a machine learning algorithm.
