My main role as the Residential Multimedia Consultant was to build and maintain the dorm website.
I discovered the needs of dorm staff and 200 residents, then designed, built, and iterated on the
website.
Other responsibilities included operating audiovisual equipment,
designing t-shirts, and creating slideshow presentations.


### Year 2
* Built new version from scratch to better tailor the website to the dorm's use cases and 
 improve performance
* Designed the frontend in Keynote
* Coded the frontend in HTML, CSS, and JS
* Designed the DB schema
* Coded the backend in PHP
* Google Calendar integration for easier calendar subscription
* Worked with a designer to come up with a new aesthetic, then made the photoshop mockup real.

### Year 1
* Self-learned the Drupal infrastructure in three weeks and integrated 17 modules for the
initial lauch of a website for 200 dorm residents.
* Self-initiated internship with <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/" target="_blank">Lullabot</a> to enhance dorm website, help other groups on campus with Drupal websites, and contribute back to open source.
